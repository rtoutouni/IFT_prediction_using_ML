In this study, we apply several Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict IFT in mixtures of two n-alkanes or alkane/CO2 at a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions. These methods include linear regression, multi-layer perceptron regression (MLP), epsilon-support vector regression (SVR), Bayesian ridge, kernel ridge, Gaussian process regression, decision tree regression. All of the ML methods are tested using interfacial tension data for binary systems CO2/n-Pentane, Propane/n-Pentane, and Propane/n-Hexane at temperature and pressure conditions ranging from 296 to 403 K and 0.2 to 6 MPa, respectively. The experimental data provided by Toutoni et al.1,2 are used as a training set to build the model and test set to find the accuracy of each model. Among all of the applied algorithms, the Gaussian process regressor with the prediction accuracy of 99.6% proved to be capable of predicting interfacial tension of binary mixtures at any pressure and temperature condition.
